        <p><b>The Internet, sometimes called simply "the Net," is a worldwide system of computer networks -- a network
                of
                networks in which users at any one computer can, if they have permission, get information from any other
                computer (and sometimes talk directly to users at other computers). It was conceived by the Advanced
                Research Projects Agency (ARPA) of the U.S. government in 1969 and was first known as the ARPANET. The
                original aim was to create a network that would allow users of a research computer at one university to
                "talk to" research computers at other universities. A side benefit of ARPANet's design was that, because
                messages could be routed or rerouted in more than one direction, the network could continue to function
                even
                if parts of it were destroyed in the event of a military attack or other disaster.

                Today, the Internet is a public, cooperative and self-sustaining facility accessible to hundreds of
                millions
                of people worldwide. It is used by many as the primary source of information consumption, and fueled the
                creation and growth of its own social ecosystem through social media and content sharing. Furthermore,
                e-commerce, or online shopping, has become one of the largest uses of the Internet.</b></p>

    <h3 align="left" style="color:navy;font-size: 30px;font-family:cursive;"><i>How The
            Internert Works?</i></h3>
    <ul>
        <p>Physically, the Internet uses a portion of the total resources of the currently existing public
            telecommunication networks. Technically, what distinguishes the Internet is its use of a set of protocols
            called
            Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP). Two recent adaptations of Internet technology, the
            Intranet and the extranet, also make use of the TCP/IP protocol.

            The Internet can be seen as having two major components: network protocols and hardware. The protocols, such
            as the
            TCP/IP suite, present sets of rules that devices must follow in order to complete tasks. Without this common
            collection of rules, machines would not be able to communicate. <br>

            The protocols are also responsible for translating the alphabetic text of a message into electronic signals
            that can
            be transmitted over the Internet, and then back again into legible, alphabetic text.<br>
            <img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQWCIo8Std33-NXjMXvOk_QaUWiJb8wfr4Raw&usqp=CAU" height="250px" width="300px" border="3" align="center"><br> Hardware, the second major component of the Internet, includes everything from the computer or smartphone
            that is
            used to access the Internet to the cables that carry information from one device to another. Additional
            types of
            hardware include satellites, radios, cell phone towers, routers and servers.

            These various types of hardware are the connections within the network. Devices such as computers,
            smartphones and
            laptops are end points, or clients, while the machines that store the information are the servers. The
            transmission
            lines that exchange the data can either be wireless signals from satellites or 4G and cell phone towers, or
            physical
            lines, such as cables and fiber optics.

            The process of transferring information from one device to another relies on packet switching. Each computer
            connected to the Internet is assigned a unique IP address that allows the device to be recognized. When one
            device
            attempts to send a message to another device, the data is sent over the Internet in the form of manageable
            packets.
            Each packet is assigned a port number that will connect it to its endpoint.

            A packet that has both a unique IP address and port number can be translated from alphabetic text into
            electronic
            signals by travelling through the layers of the OSI model from the top application layer to the bottom
            physical
            layer. The message will then be sent over the Internet where it is received by the Internet service
            provider's (ISP)
            router. The router will examine the destination address assigned to each packet and determine where to send
            it.

            Eventually, the packet reaches the client and travels in reverse from the bottom physical layer of the OSI
            model to
            the top application layer. During this process, the routing data -- the port number and IP address -- is
            stripped
            from the packet, thus allowing the data to be translated back into alphabetic text and completing the
            transmission
            process</p>
